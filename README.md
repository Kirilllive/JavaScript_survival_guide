# Plot
After many years of flight, a spaceship with colonists in cryosnes arrives on a new planet. During the trip, many data on the main computer of the ship were damaged, including information about the crew and other people.

Artificial intelligence Harmony was unable to solve problems on its own due to its limitations in access to some systems. Therefore, she decides to wake up the only person about whom there was enough information to do it safely.

Together they must restore the ship's systems to save the rest of the people. Fortunately, JavaScript was used as the primary language for ship systems due to its simplicity and functionality.


# Development

The project is in the early stages of development!!!
